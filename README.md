# üëã Hey, I'm Riley Greenstein

I'm a high school student in San Francisco and the founder of **The AI Coding Club** at Lowell High School. I love computer science, especially where it overlaps with artificial intelligence. I love using tools like ChatGPT and GitHub Copilot to build smarter and faster. I believe this type of assisted programming is the future.

## ü§ñ About the club

**AI Coding Club** is a student-led group focused on using AI to boost how we learn and code. We run weekly sessions where we:

- Explore tools like ChatGPT, Copilot, BubbleAI
- Build coding projects with the help of AI  
- Learn how to prompt more efficiently, debug smarter, and create faster  
- Talk about the ethics + future of AI-assisted coding
- Compete against other club members in prompt competitions (non-competitive, just for fun)

We're based in San Francisco, and always open to collaborations, guest speakers, and partnerships that help club members learn and build more efficiently with AI.
