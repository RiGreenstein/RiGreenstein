# Hey, I'm Riley Greenstein

I'm a high school student in San Francisco and the soon-to-be founder of **The AI Coding Club** at Lowell High School. I love computer science, especially where it overlaps with artificial intelligence. I use Tools like Qodo and GitHub Copilot to help me code more efficiently. I believe this type of assisted programming is the future.

## About the club

**The AI Coding Club** is a student-led, teacher-assisted group focused on using AI to improve how to learn and code. We have weekly sessions where we:

- Explore tools like ChatGPT, Copilot, BubbleAI
- Build coding projects with the help of AI  
- Learn how to prompt more efficiently and create faster  
- Talk about the ethics + future of AI-assisted programming
- Compete against other club members in prompt competitions (non-competitive, just for fun)

## Current focus

- Writing scripts and building games with the help of AI
- Running our first AI prompt competition
- Connecting with AI organizations for tools, mentorship, or collabs
